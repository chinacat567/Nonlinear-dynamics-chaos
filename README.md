# Nonlinear-dynamics-chaos

This is an educational project for modeling, simulation, and visualization of discrete nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos. This is in extension to the undergraduate course (BITS F316) I did in my 4th year at BITS Pilani, Pilani campus in fall 2017. I have modelled the following systems in specific:

1. Lorenz attrcator 
2. Henon map
3. Logistic map
4. Van der Pol Oscillator

I have used "Pynamical", an open source python module for the visualizations. The output is visualized in various ways, including with bifurcation diagrams, two-dimensional phase diagrams, three-dimensional phase diagrams, and cobweb plots . These visualizations enable simple qualitative assessments of system behavior including phase transitions (Feigenbaum 1983), bifurcation points (Sander and Yorke 2015), attractors and limit cycles (Grebogi et al. 1987), basins of attraction (Sprott and Xiong 2015), and fractals (Mandelbrot 1967; 1983).

Although most real-world systems are nonlinear dynamical systems, their mathematical analysis is notoriously difficult because they cannot be simply broken down into individual parts then recombined linearly (Strogatz 2014). Instead, researchers have long relied on visualization techniques to make system behavior comprehensible (Alpigini 2004; Layek 2015). Such visualization is useful for exploring nonlinear time series data (Bradley and Kantz 2015; Boeing 2016).
